## Latest Developments

- [2022.7.20] To reduce repetitive work and focus on development and maintenance in later versions, **EISeg will only be updated on the official repository [PaddlePaddle/PaddeSeg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg/tree/release/2.6/EISeg) later, and this repository will not be updated**. Thank you very much for your company and support all the way. EISeg will do its best to provide you with more and better annotation functions. Welcome to experience the new address and hope you will continue to support me.
